    "In this section, you'll continue solidifying your knowledge of Python programming, descriptive statistics, and data visualization by performing key data analysis tasks. You will learn how to load data from CSV and JSON files into Python objects in memory, and wrap up with an analysis that joins together two datasets.\n",

    "## Lesson Priorities\n",
    "### 1st Priority\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are short on time, be sure to make it through these items:\n",
    "- File Input and Output in Python\n",
    "- CSV\n",
    "- JSON\n",
    "- Data Serialization Formats - Cumulative Lab\n",
    "> Note: If you can't yet see the cumulative lab, don't worry.  It may not be visible until a pair programming session led by your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2nd Priority\n",
    "- JSON - Lab: \n",
    ">Good additional practice with key/value pairs, accessing a list by index values, and for loops.\n",

    "- Working with Known JSON Schemas - Lab\n",

    "In it you will find even another opportunity to practice JSON's in the **Exploring and Transforming JSON Schemas** lesson/lab pair.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You will also find a lesson/lab pair that goes into more detail about XML. XML is less important than JSON to the scope of the program, but important to know about for webscraping and general familiarity with common data structures.\n",

    "## Base Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When we say \"base Python\", this means that we are emphasizing the data types and modules that are part of Python itself, rather than using third-party libraries. For much of this course, you will use numerous Python libraries such as `pandas` and StatsModels, but first we want to dig into how data analysis tasks can be performed without them.\n",

    "### Python Data Types and Control Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, our data is stored in data structures that are built into the Python language: numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc. For example, if we have this table of data:\n",

    "| orange | 1      |\n",

    "\n",
    "Then to print out the colors, in the base Python example we had a `for` loop and then code to extract the information from each individual dictionary. The string values got printed out without any additional markup. Then in the pandas example we did not have to use a loop (hint: this is *broadcasting* like we saw previously with NumPy) and also we had some extra markup where it printed out the index values as well as `Name: color, dtype: object`.\n",
